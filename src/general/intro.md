This book aims to be a quick reference for programmers. Its goal is not to
explain each technology, but instead to be a quick reference card.

For each argument, these are the points that are discussed.

* Big Picture
	* Here a brief explanation of the reasons why the technology is important
	is given. This section gives the programmer the minimum knowledge to sustain
	a chat about the argument. Questions like the following ones are answered
	in this section.
		* What the hell is that ?
		* What it is needed for ?
		* What can I do with that ?
		* Why should I be aware of that ?
* Main Concepts
	* Each technology has its core concepts you should understand to 
	properly use it.
* Set Up
	* A brief explanation about how you can install the technology.
	Not all the main ways you can install it are covered. But at least we
	try to give you a simple way you can start with.
* Problems And Solutions
	* If there are typical problems a programmer is going to face while she 
	start with the new technology, we try to address them in this section,
	along with the possible answers.
* Examples
	* Short examples about how to use the technology.
	
Happy reading.
