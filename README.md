# Build

- Prepare a `.index` file containing the relative paths of the `.md`s you want to be included in a "book".
- Add a build line in the `build.sh`, specifying the index file and the name of the folder where you want the script to place the produced files. For instance, you can add `build_epub "docker.index" docker`
- Run `build.sh`
