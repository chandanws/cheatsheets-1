			Hi all! I work mainly as programmer, and most of the time I integrate
			exisiting solutions to produce running software good enough to make
			someone willing to pay for it. I would say a pretty common scenario.
			</p>

			<p>
			In my day by day activity I have to tackle an enormous amount of latest-technologies,
			definitive-methodologies, tools. Definitively too much to be stored in my head.
			</p>

			<p>
			So I started writing down notes on those things, so I'm slowing put together
			a fairly big amouunt of notes that I share here. 
			</p>

			<p>
			I hope you can find that useful for your work.

				Maven is a very powerful tool, but I sometimes found hard to embrace
				its "do like I say you should do" policy. 
				There are obviously lot of good points in using Maven. Among all 
				it enables you to start working on yet-another-totally-unknown-project quite quickly
				if your-totally-unknown-colleague-that-is-leaving-the-company-for-big-money
				leaves you the honour to publish the project in produciton.
				But in the other hand there are a lot of tricks you better know if you want to take
				full advantage of it.

				Docker is one of those mind changing technologies.
				It packs a set of already existing technologies in such a smart, usable, nice way
				that it makes think about some aspect of your job in a completely different
				way.
